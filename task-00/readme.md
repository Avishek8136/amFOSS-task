# Install Ubuntu [Desktop]

This was easy task for me. To install ubuntu, I created a bootable usb drive using Yumi and setting its partition type as gpt which was my partition type. Then after changing secure boot menu to false, I booted my pc with the usb to my 8 gb ram desktop and provided Ubuntu a total size of around 120 GB and 16 GB as swap area for linux and installed Ubuntu in my system.
